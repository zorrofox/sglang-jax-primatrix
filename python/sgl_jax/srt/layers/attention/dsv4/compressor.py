"""M2.2 -- offline compressor and continuation state.

One compressed record is produced per completed group. The record pools a window
of per-token *state* rows, normalises, and applies RoPE:

    kv     = x @ wkv^T                                  [T, coff*D]
    score  = x @ wgate^T + ape[position % ratio]        [T, coff*D]
    weight = softmax(score_window, axis=window)         per feature, over the window
    pooled = sum(weight * kv_window, axis=window)
    normed = pooled * rsqrt(mean(pooled^2) + eps) * norm_weight
    record = interleaved_rope(normed, cos_sin[compressed_pos], rope_head_dim)

Semantics are taken from tpu-inference's reference
(`kernels/experimental/deepseek_v4/compress_and_store/compress_store_ref.py`:
`gather_state_windows` / `compress_norm_rope`) and agree with the independent fp32
oracle that landed with the HCA kernels in `test/srt/kernels/hca/oracle.py`. They
are not re-derived here -- an earlier attempt to reason out a related rule from
first principles produced a wrong visibility mask that reached `epic/dsv4`.

Overlap: why a ratio-4 ring is eight deep
-----------------------------------------
CSA (ratio 4) compresses with *overlapping* windows and HCA (ratio 128) does not::

    coff   = 1 + int(overlap)          # CSA 2, HCA 1
    window = coff * ratio              # CSA 8, HCA 128

Each token stores ``coff`` content fields and ``coff`` score fields, each `head_dim`
wide. A record ending at position ``p`` pools the ``window`` token-states
``p-window+1 .. p``, reading **field 0 for the older half of the window and field 1
for the newer half**. That is the whole of "overlap": not two records, one record
over twice as many tokens with a different projection per half.

So the ring is exactly `window` deep, and `position % window` addresses it. That is
also why a long chunk must not be written into the ring before pooling: with
`window` = 8 and a 512-token chunk, the earliest groups' states would be overwritten
before they were ever read. This module computes from *old state plus this chunk's
projections* and only then saves the tail, which is the option the M2.2 brief
allows and the one that needs no ordering discipline from the caller.

State layout matches C1's pool (`DeepseekV4CompressStatePool`):
``[slot, window, 2*coff*head_dim]`` float32, contents in the first half of the last
axis and scores in the second, empty contents zero and empty scores ``-inf``.
